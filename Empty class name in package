What is the cause of “Empty class name in package” while install app on Android 9.0 emulator?

For someone stumbling here, I had the same problem when app was not installing in Android 9.0

The problem was android:appComponentFactory="" (it is empty in the merged manifest as shown in line #68) and failing to install on Android 9.0 (works fine below Pie)

The solution was to remove appComponentFactory from tools:replace="icon,theme,appComponentFactory"

If it still fails, try migrating to androidx. However above solution worked for me.
